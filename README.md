## Overview

This project was made with the idea of putting in practice concepts like Flex-wrap, event listeners and variable scopes. I felt less difficulty designing the interface of this project thanks to previous solutions I made in recent days.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

Since I've been using Flexbox for my previous solutions I thought it was a good opportunity to take it to the next level and implement some flex-wrap for the responsiveness of the layout. Besides from that I put to work some other Javascript concepts like variables scope and event listeners.

### Continued development

This is my third Frontend Mentor challenge which helps me setting up my new streak of submitting a new solution for a challenge every week.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - It's always useful having an official source of truth. This website helps to be up to date with new changes made for Javascript and CSS tools
- [W3Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - Having always a bit code to mess with and make sure of understanding a property comes very handy.
